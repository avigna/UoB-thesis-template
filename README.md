# UoB-thesis-template
This repository contains some files which draft a template for a PhD thesis. It is written in Latex and contains several files, images and subdirectories that can compiled to generate a minimalistic thesis-like document. This template was developed by Jim Barret and Alejandro Vigna-GÃ³mez, both alumni from the University of Birmingham. A complete thesis made using this template was accepted on September 2019 by the College of Engineering and Physical Sciences from the University of Birmingham. This template has not been officially approved and it just here to offer a guidance. 

For looking at the format, download and open the pre-compiled file **thesisTemplateUoB.pdf**.
